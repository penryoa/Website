<h1>So websites are complicated.</h1>
<p>
Access me via "localhost" or "http://10.224.89.50/" in the address bar!
<br><br>Note: External IP is 24.100.43.105. Internal IP is 10.224.89.50. There's a website that tells you your IP (whatismyip.com or something) and you can see your external IP. Then find your internal IP by typing the external IP in the address bar. Should be somewhere on the given page.
<br><br>SO. I can't make this public bc I can't change the forwarding address of port 80 to the internal IP. Can't go into the settings for interner (192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.0).
