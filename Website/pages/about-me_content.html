				I'm Addi, a software developer from Indiana. I have a hodgepodge of interests and hobbies and not enough time to tend to them all. I'm a motorcyclist, musician, avid tea drinker, and aspiring game developer. Cats are pretty great and thankfully I have two: Dragon and Mykie (which are featured in pictures below, as any animal parent is required to do).

			<h3>music</h3>
			<p>
				Piano has been my favorite instrument since I watched a Mars documentary at an IMAX theater on a fieldtrip. A cool piano melody stuck in my head and I've been playing ever since.
				<br>I've been singing as long as I can remember as well and have pretty much always been involved in a choir.
				<br>Guitar is my newest flame. It's been fun to learn and painful to build callouses, but worth it.

			<h3>languages</h3>
			<p>
				I started learning French about seven years ago and studied for three years. I'm trying to get back into it and take a trip to Canada! 
				<br>Japanese has been my target language for about a year now, though with an intense college schedule, time was hard to find. My long-term goal is to get through the JLPT5 and JLPT4.

			<h3>motorcycles</h3>
			<p>
				Roxas, my bike, is a 2007 Honda Shadow. I've had him for two years. In that time, I've taken plenty of day trips and visited places even four hours away. Highly recommend it (if you take safety seriously)!
				<br>At one point, I had to take my dad on the back of my bike in the pouring rain at night. He had a full gas canister in his lap. I prefer more leisurely rides than that.

			<h3>video games</h3>
			<p>
				I'm a sucker for Nintendo games. Growing up with N64 and Super Nintendo led to a pretty inevitable obsession with Zelda games especially. Animal Crossing will always be a soft spot for me.
				<br>Outside of Nintendo, my games of choice are predictable: Skyrim, Fallout, COD, Minecraft. I've watched a lot more games be played than I've played myself honestly, the best ones being Fran Bow and other horror/spooky games.
