<h1>about this site</h1>

<div><h2>intentions</h2>
	<p>I first started making this site at the beginning of June 2020 with some simple intentions:</p>
	<ul class="simple-list">
		<li>grow my skills by trying out new tools (like Bootstrap, Angular, etc)</li>
		<li>show off some of those skills</li>
		<li>create a platform that feels like "me"</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There's a ton of things I look forward to doing and I'm only starting out. Having my own website lets me document my journey <em>~in style~</em>.</p></div>

<div><h2>plans and features</h2>
	<p>I plan to develop and release the following features:</p>
	<ul class="simple-list">
		<!-- <li>interactive travel app
			<ul>
				<li>it'd help me plan my trips nicely and save info about the trips I've been on.</li>
				<li>the main purpose is to use a database</li>
			</ul>
		</li> -->
		<li>an arcade-like mini game
			<ul>
				<li>no strong ideas yet. I just want something that lets me further practice object oriented design and makes me laugh.</li>
				<li>will be written in Java or C++</li>
				<li>will be open source and possibly on Steam</li>
				</ul></li>
		<li>interactive budgeting app</li>
		<li>gallery of photos of my cats and hamster</li>
		<li>poem collection</li>
		<li>original music collection (audio, lyrics, download, etc.)</li>
		<li>video game project
			<ul>
				<li>this will be a full game released independently or through Steam</li>
				<li>so far it is still in the design process with limited art and music, but I plan on releasing content as I progress.</li>
				<li>all the music, art, and code will be done by me, so it's a huge project! it'll be a while before it's released.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></div>

	<h2>a little anecdote</h2>
	<p>For my senior project (August 2019 - May 2020), I spent most of my time working with PHP, HTML, and CSS. I was most proud of making two \"buttons\" using only HTML/CSS that would toggle visibility of a section, one above and one below the section to toggle.
	<br><br>So it looked like this:</p>
	<div class="centered-content">
		<br>|------------------|
		<br>|--button 1 --|
		<br>|------------------|
		<br>Some content in a div
		<br>|------------------|
		<br>|--button 2 --|
		<br>|------------------|
	</div>
	<p><br>Button 1 and 2 aren't buttons, <i>but tons</i> of fun because they're just HTML checkbox inputs styled as buttons. I used classes and made it so if the content was hidden, Button 2 was also hidden.
	<br>In retrospect, this isn't super impressive. But at the time, I had no experience and this felt like a huge success. :)</p>
