	<p>Given how much it helps me when others have open-source code, I try to do the same when appropriate. I have some sample code <a class="simple_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://github.com/penryoa/rose-hulman_backup'>from class projects I've been part of</a>, as well as code <a class="simple_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://github.com/KixorTech/CourseUp/tree/staging'>from my senior project</a> working with a client who has the codebase as open-source. Code <a class="simple_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://github.com/penryoa/Website'>for this site</a> is accessible as well.</p>
