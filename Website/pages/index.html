		<p> click on the links on the right to do stuff my dude.

		<br>I belong in an asylum and I’m not even twenty
		<br>The straight jacket’s tight but a perfect fit on me
		<br>You could lock me in a padlock and I wouldn’t fight back. If
		<br>You ask why I’m a lunatic, you’d be sorry you asked it.
		<br>I was sentenced to tragedy before my mom fucked my dad, it’s 
		<br>In my veins to be insane and piss into my casket
		<br>And say “Fuck it” because who cares how much money I spend
		<br>When I know that denial is my only true friend?
		<br>I thought I wasn’t an angry person, but fuck, I was wrong
		<br>Because I feel fire from my core bleeding into every song.
