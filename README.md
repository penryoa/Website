# Personal Website

This is an ongoing project that was started at the beginning of June 2020, so it is always improving!

The site can be accessed at http://thecalmplexcoder.com

TODO (to get the site back to functional):

- Fix navbar; not sticky anymore for some reason
- Fix menu to not just take up 1/4 of the screen but overlay
- Combine About Site and Home pages
- Merge Resume page into About Me page
- Keep moving out the complicated `tailwind.css` stylings into the code itself
- Find a way to get ALL the tailwind options to generate, or at the very least, all the ones I actually need. I especially need the classNames in the `tailwind.css` and colors listed elsewhere to be available.

NEW FEATURES TO ADD:

- Reset hamburger button to be a skull
- Blog page. ez.
- ? Contact page (sends emails to me)
