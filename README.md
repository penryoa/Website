# Personal Website
This is an ongoing project that was started at the beginning of June 2020, so it is always improving, but doesn't represent my best. It's more personal expression than a beacon of professionalism. As Trixie and Katya says, "Because it's our [website], and not yours."

## New Features to Implement
- Move the articles to a DB
- Convert the whole thing to a MERN stack (or just use a Java/Python backend? TBD)
- Create a contact page featuring an email address and socials
- Search in blog header (use url maybe? tags? TBD)
- Write a few more articles in the blog to fill it out

## Known Bugs/Malpractices
- Inconsistent formatting and use of the JsDocs; want to use TypeScript to establish types and standardize JsDocs formatting
- React Components should be in .jsx files as a best practice
- The multi-select on the blog landing page: when you delete all tags and add one back in, it shows dramatically larger for some reason
- The background repeats awkwardly at shorter screen heights; not a huge priority to fix, but on the list nonetheless
- Instead of having the photos and articles in the repo, use their paths on the server to grab them
