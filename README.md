# Personal Website

This is an ongoing project that was started at the beginning of June 2020, so it is always improving!
The site can be accessed by [thecalmplexcoder.com](http://www.thecalmplexcoder.com).

The website is very much intended for personal use and not necessarily a beacon of professionalism. As Trixie and Katya says, "Because it's our [website], and not yours."

## New Features to Implement
- Write a few more articles in the blog to fill it out
- Move the articles to a DB and access via Java or Python backend
- Search in blog header (use url maybe? tags? TBD)
- Create a contact page featuring an email address and socials

## Old Features to Fix
- The multi-select on the blog landing page: when you delete all tags and add one back in, it shows dramatically larger for some reason. Need to fix that
- The pictures load in slow (I mean it's hosted on a Pi, what do you expect), so make sure there's some loading indication (page or image) so the user has a clean view
- The background repeats awkwardly at shorter screen heights; not a huge priority to fix, but on the list nonetheless
